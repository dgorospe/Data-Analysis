# Data-Analysis

This project was for the Independent Study course I took under Professor Francisco Iacobelli at Northeastern Illinois University. The course included NoSQL database (MongoDB) and data analysis using R. 
The data used for this project was pulled from Chicago Data Portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present-Dashboard/5cd6-ry5g). This data consisted of 6,545,514 observations and 24 variables.
